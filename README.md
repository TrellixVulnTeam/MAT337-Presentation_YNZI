# Important Files

* `fourier_interactive.py`: This script gets an arbitrary function over the interval [\pi, \pi] and shows the convergence of its Fourier series to the function as the number of terms included increase using a slider.

* `poisson_kekrnal_interactive.py`: This is a graph of the Poisson Kernel as a function of \theta, and the value of r can be controlled using a slider.

* `poisson-kernel_picture.py`: This produces the graph on slide 42 of the presentation in `presentation.pdf`.

* `string_graph.py`: This is a simulation of the solution to the vibrating string problem.

* `temperature_graph`: A 3d graph solution to the heat equation on a unit disc, for an arbitrarily given boundary condition.

`presentation.pdf`: The main presentation PDF.
